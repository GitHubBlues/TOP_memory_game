## **Summer-themed memory game**

This is a simple memory game displaying different images. You win, if you manage to click once (and only once!) on each card. 
The game is made with react and makes use of hooks (useState and useEffect). 

The app was developed in the context of Odin's Project, as indicated in the [project specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card).
